# 👋 Welcome!

I'm **Mikhail Biriuchinskii**, an R&D engineer and NLP/TAL specialist based in Paris.  
I build tools and systems at the intersection of **language, AI, and data** — with a particular focus on open-source, multimodal processing (text, speech, image) and large language models (LLMs).

---

## 🧠 Who I Am

I work on real-world applications of natural language processing and computational linguistics.  
My areas of focus include:

- 🧾 **Text and document understanding** — OCR/HTR, multilingual processing, historical archives  
- 🧠 **Large Language Models** — Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- 🗣 **Speech and audio** — Low-resource languages, Whisper-based pipelines  
- 🧰 **Annotation & evaluation workflows** — FAIR data, human-in-the-loop systems  
- 🛠 **Deployment & tooling** — Docker, FastAPI, open-access web apps for researchers

I value **clarity**, **rigor**, and **interdisciplinary collaboration** — especially between computer science and the humanities.
