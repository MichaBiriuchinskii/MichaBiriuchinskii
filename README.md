# 👋 Welcome

I'm **Mikhail Biriuchinskii**, an R&D Data Scientist and NLP specialist in Paris.

I build tools at the intersection of **language, AI, and data**, with a focus on open-source, multimodal processing (text, speech, image), and large language models (LLMs).

## 🧠 About Me

I apply NLP and computational linguistics to real-world problems, with expertise in:

- 🧾 **Text & documents** — OCR/HTR, multilingual, historical archives  
- 🧠 **LLMs** — Fine-tuning, prompt design, retrieval-augmented generation  
- 🗣 **Speech** — Low-resource languages, Whisper pipelines  
- 🧰 **Annotation & evaluation** — FAIR data, human-in-the-loop workflows  
- 🛠 **Deployment & tooling** — Docker, FastAPI, open-access apps

I value **clarity**, **rigor**, and **collaboration**—especially across tech and the humanities.
